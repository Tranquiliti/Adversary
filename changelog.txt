* Added "customDescriptionId" option for planets, stars, and some custom entities.
  - Updated Penelope's Star mirror in presetStarSystems.json to use this option
  - Updated referenceSetting.json
* Updated MagicLib bounties:
  - Added a bounty against the Luddic Church, posted by the Adversary (partly a placeholder until 0.96 comes)
  - Changed/reworked all ship variants in the Pirate and Hegemony bounties
  - Increased the reward for the Independent bounty
* More code refactors




Version 3.2.1

* Fixed "isCoreWorldSystem" toggle doing the complete opposite (e.g. tagging the Optimal system as a proc-gen system and not a Core World system).



Version 3.2.0

* Updated LunaLib compatibility yet again (now with an actual changelog!)
  - Note that setting IDs have been changed, so you may need to set your LunaLib settings for this mod again.
* Added "hasSystemwideNebula" toggle for custom star systems, allowing for nebula clouds to appear in your custom star systems.
  - The default uninhabited system now has this set to "true".
* Custom star systems created with "setLocation" now set their star age to that of their selected constellation.
  - This affects the nebula color if the system's "hasSystemwideNebula" is set to "true".
* Stars in the "stars" list of "starsInSystemCenter" can now have "specChanges" as well.
* Fixed optional blueprint stealer setting not correctly resetting the elapsed months after each steal attempt.
* Exotica Technologies:
  - Updated the Adversary faction with the latest exotics and upgrades
  - Decreased chance for faction-exclusive exotics and upgrades to appear in Adversary ships
* Major code refactors



Version 3.1.0

* Updated LunaLib compatibility:
  - LunaLib settings for the Adversary mod now immediately apply to an existing save, without needing to reload a save.
  - Added "Adversary Doctrine Change Delay" and "Adversary Blueprint Change Delay" as LunaLib settings
* Reformated and renamed some settings in settings.json to account for the above change.
* Adjusted default uninhabited custom system:
  - Gas Giant now has "Hot" instead of "Extreme Heat" to encourage using the Orbital Fusion Lamp to maximize Cryoarithmetic Engine efficacy.
  - Added sparse ore deposits to Barren planet to make Mining an option.
* Added "specChanges" option for any planets or stars in "orbitingBodies".
  - This allows changing the appearance of a planet or star.
  - Updated Penelope's Star copy in presetStarSystems.json with the appropriate "specChanges"



Version 3.0.0

* Added "enableAdversaryBlueprintStealing" and its corresponding "adversaryBlueprintStealingSettings".
  - Set to false by default, it allows the Adversary to learn the blueprints of specific factions after some time.
  - Default settings has the Adversary steal blueprints from the player faction every new cycle.
* Expanded "adversaryDoctrineChangeSettings":
  - Now supports modifying the exact fleet composition and doctrine (e.g. can set doctrine to 3-3-1 fleet composition and 5-1-1 fleet doctrine for warships and carriers with high-level officers)
  - Replaced "warships", "carriers", etc. with "possibleDoctrines", which holds the possible doctrines the Adversary may use.
* Added some LunaLib support
  - The LunaLib toggle settings are: Enable Custom Star Systems, Enable Adversary Doctrine Change, Enable Adversary Blueprint Stealing
  - If LunaLib is enabled, these toggles will override their settings.json equivalent.
* Added Better Colonies mod support for the Adversary faction; they will now participate in the Age of Innovation.
* Added a mirror version of Penelope's Star to presetStarSystems.json
* Tweaked the Adversary's default carrier doctrines to use a wider variety of fighters.
