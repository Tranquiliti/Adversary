Version 6.2.3

* Added Second-in-Command mod support for MagicBounties
  - Added "enableSCSupportForBounties" setting in settings.json
  - Requires Second-in-Command version 1.1.2 or above to work perfectly (else you'll crash when accepting the bounties)
  - When enabled, all MagicBounties from this mod now get fixed, custom-made SiC executive officers instead of random ones
  - Due to the experimental nature, and as SiC is expected to develop rapidly, this support is currently disabled by default



Version 6.2.2

* Slight adjustments to planetary orbits for the Optimal system (including the newly-added US version)
* Significantly reduced the prep time for the enraged Adversary CC attack
* Added "consistent weapon drop" tag to ship variants using Omega weapons in two Silly MagicBounties
* Other minor MagicBounty fixes
* Minor text changes
* Spelling fixes (contributed by Nissa)



Version 6.2.1

* Added a new Silly MagicBounty, available after defeating the Tri-Tachyon bounty
* Adjusted the Tri-Tachyon bounty; should be harder overall
* Added a new custom star system for the Adversary in customStarSystems.json
  - Basically the Optimal system, but with Unknown Skies features
  - Disabled by default; requires the Unknown Skies mod to successfully enable with no issues



Version 6.2.0

* MagicBounty changes:
  - Added a new Silly MagicBounty
  - Adjusted bounty preview visibility for a few MagicBounties
  - Adjusted bounty rewards for some MagicBounties
  - Minor text changes
* Slight adjustments to Adversary crisis:
  - Can no longer trigger another attack while an existing Adversary attack is already underway
  - More emphasis on system market presence when choosing a target system to attack
  - Reduced Independent reputation gain for defeating the Adversary crisis attack
* Major code refactors



Version 6.1.2

* Minor fixes for the new MagicBounty
* Fixed a crash that could occur if at least one of the Adversary's High Command industries did not have an installed AI core



Version 6.1.1

* Added a new Silly MagicBounty
* Fixed Adversary CC point contribution for size 7 or higher colonies (now +10 per size 7 or higher colony, from +1)
* Made Adversary CC factor able to appear in main Colony Crisis intel in the middle of a game session
  - Was previously only added-in/checked-for upon loading a save with an existing CC intel, and could be temporarily removed if CC intel disappeared (via losing all colonies) and then reappeared within the same game session
  - Only applies if Adversary Dynamic Doctrine is enabled; else, the previous behavior still applies



Version 6.1.0 (Not save-compatible with 6.0.0)

* Added a Colony Crisis for the Adversary faction
  - Will (normally) appear if you are hostile to the Adversary and either have one size 6 colony, or at least 4 colonies with one being at least size 5
* Adjusted Adversary configs:
  - Now uses the new 0.97a character portraits
  - Now knows the Escort Package hullmod, and no longer knows the Neural Link hullmods
  - Will no longer send punitive expeditions for any reason except Colony Crisis and territorial claims
* Adjusted some MagicBounty ship variants and commander skills
* Major code refactoring



Version 6.0.0 (Update for Starsector 0.97)

* Updated to Starsector 0.97
* Added Grendel to Adversary's known ship list
