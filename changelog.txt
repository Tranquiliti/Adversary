Version 5.2.1

* MagicBounty changes:
  - Changed ship loadouts and officer skills for most MagicBounties in preparation of Starsector 0.97
  - Added [REDACTED PLUS] prerequisite for two [VERY REDACTED] Silly bounties
  - The Silly station bounties now have far fewer fleetwide skills; to compensate, the stations now have additional ships to support them
  - Some reward adjustments
* Updated Adversary's Exotica configs to include Quick Jets



Version 5.2.0 (Not save-compatible)

* Fixed the LunaLib soft dependency
  - This means this mod no longer requires either LunaLib or Java 8 to run
* Removed "fleetDoctrine" and "shipSize" options for Adversary's Dynamic Doctrine
  - This is done as these options are barely used by default and can conflict with mods that dynamically increase NPC faction strength
* Made officers in a certain Silly bounty count as sleeper officers
* Added voices to the Adversary for more consistent dialogue



Version 5.1.1

* Added missing Missile Specialization skill to all Silly station bounty targets.
  - Increased credit rewards to compensate
* Added a thematic reward for a certain Silly bounty
* Updated Adversary's Exotica configs to include Oversized Magazines



Version 5.1.0

* Add 4 silly MagicBounties centered around extremely lethal station battles.
  - Requires MagicLib, as well as enabling "enableAdversarySillyBounties" in settings.json or LunaSettings
  - These bounties have highly-valuable rewards, but with an extreme difficulty to match.
* Fixed Paradiso system not being a Core system and having a misplaced sensor array.



Version 5.0.0

* Split off the custom star system feature to the Customizable Star Systems mod
  - Adversary portion now has a dependency on this split-off mod
  - Updated Adversary's customStarSystem.json with the updated format
* Added a game-breaking, modded Adversary system to customStarSystems.json
  - Disabled by default
  - Requires both Industrial.Evolution and Unknown Skies to successfully enable
  - Not for the faint-hearted
* Changed source code and package names
