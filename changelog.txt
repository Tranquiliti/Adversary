Version 6.2.0

* MagicBounty changes:
  - Added a new Silly MagicBounty
  - Adjusted bounty preview visibility for a few MagicBounties
  - Adjusted bounty rewards for some MagicBounties
  - Minor text changes
* Slight adjustments to Adversary crisis:
  - Can no longer trigger another attack while an existing Adversary attack is already underway
  - More emphasis on system market presence when choosing a target system to attack
  - Reduced Independent reputation gain for defeating the Adversary crisis attack
* Major code refactors



Version 6.1.2

* Minor fixes for the new MagicBounty
* Fixed a crash that could occur if at least one of the Adversary's High Command industries did not have an installed AI core



Version 6.1.1

* Added a new Silly MagicBounty
* Fixed Adversary CC point contribution for size 7 or higher colonies (now +10 per size 7 or higher colony, from +1)
* Made Adversary CC factor able to appear in main Colony Crisis intel in the middle of a game session
  - Was previously only added-in/checked-for upon loading a save with an existing CC intel, and could be temporarily removed if CC intel disappeared (via losing all colonies) and then reappeared within the same game session
  - Only applies if Adversary Dynamic Doctrine is enabled; else, the previous behavior still applies



Version 6.1.0 (Not save-compatible with 6.0.0)

* Added a Colony Crisis for the Adversary faction
  - Will (normally) appear if you are hostile to the Adversary and either have one size 6 colony, or at least 4 colonies with one being at least size 5
* Adjusted Adversary configs:
  - Now uses the new 0.97a character portraits
  - Now knows the Escort Package hullmod, and no longer knows the Neural Link hullmods
  - Will no longer send punitive expeditions for any reason except Colony Crisis and territorial claims
* Adjusted some MagicBounty ship variants and commander skills
* Major code refactoring



Version 6.0.0 (Update for Starsector 0.97)
