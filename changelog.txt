Version 6.4.1

* Adversary doctrine changes:
  - Officer quality/ship quality/fleet size distribution is now 5/1/1 (from 3/2/2)
  - Commander skills changed to Officer Training and Crew Training (from Support Doctrine and Crew Training)
  - This change should optimize both the Adversary's auto-resolve strength and in-combat strength
* Minor code refactors



Version 6.4.0

* Adversary officers now always generate with at least 1 set skill
  - All doctrines, including the default/base doctrine, always use Combat Endurance as the 1st skill
  - Non-default Adversary doctrines will prioritize at least 3 officer skills, tailored towards the doctrine's ship choices
  - Added "officerSkills" to "adversaryPossibleDoctrines" in settings.json
* Adjusted the specialized Adversary doctrines:
  - Much more selective and coherent with ship, weapon, and fighter choices
  - Now prioritizes larger logistic ships (e.g., Atlas, Prometheus, Revenant, etc.)
  - Should generally make those doctrines more interesting to face off against while they are active
* Added Gorgon SRM Pod and Gazer SRM Pod to Adversary's known weapon list (I forgot)
* Moved Commissioned Crews hullmod code to "org.tranquility.adversary.hullmods"
  - If you have that mod installed, make sure to remove all CHM hullmods from your fleet before updating!



Version 6.3.1

* Added basic Ashes of the Domain: Question of Loyalty mod support
  - Mainly just setting rank/points thresholds similar to the major vanilla factions; no special ranks yet
* Fixed Pirate bounty not correctly configuring its officers
* "enableAdversarySCSupport" is now enabled by default
* Changed some SiC skills for some MagicBounties

  - All High Commands now have SP improvements (from only the Gas Giant)
  - Gas Giant: Heavy Batteries now has an SP improvement
  - Toxic planet: Megaport now uses a Gamma Core (from Alpha Core)
  - Barren planet: Replaced Fullerene Spool with a Hypershunt Tap; its Megaport now has an SP improvement
  - Jungle planet: Removed Fullerene Spool and Combat Drone Replicator; its Megaport now has an SP improvement
  - Adjusted planetary conditions for the Unknown Skies version
* Added an optional Adversary custom star system in customStarSystems.json
  - Requires both Unknown Skies and Industrial.Evolution to successfully enable with no issues
  - Essentially a balanced version of the Paradiso system
  - Contains most vanilla and Industrial.Evolution special items, as well as the [REDACTED] ruined buildings
* Changed "enableSCSupportForBounties" setting to "enableAdversarySCSupport"
  - Added the corresponding LunaSetting; still disabled by default
  - Changed SiC skills for many MagicBounties
* Adversary CC scout fleet no longer spawns with non-phase civilian ships
* Fixed Mutual Tenacity stability tooltip showing the doubled bonus despite already being doubled
  - Actual bonus still unchanged; this just aligns it with the vanilla tooltip for the boosted Luddic Majority condition
* Some code refactors



Version 6.2.3

* Added Second-in-Command mod support for MagicBounties
  - Added "enableSCSupportForBounties" setting in settings.json
  - Requires Second-in-Command version 1.1.2 or above to work perfectly (else you'll crash when accepting the bounties)
  - When enabled, all MagicBounties from this mod now get fixed, custom-made SiC executive officers instead of random ones
  - Due to the experimental nature, and as SiC is expected to develop rapidly, this support is currently disabled by default



Version 6.2.2

* Fixed Adversary CC point contribution for size 7 or higher colonies (now +10 per size 7 or higher colony, from +1)
* Made Adversary CC factor able to appear in main Colony Crisis intel in the middle of a game session
  - Was previously only added-in/checked-for upon loading a save with an existing CC intel, and could be temporarily removed if CC intel disappeared (via losing all colonies) and then reappeared within the same game session
  - Only applies if Adversary Dynamic Doctrine is enabled; else, the previous behavior still applies



Version 6.1.0 (Not save-compatible with 6.0.0)
