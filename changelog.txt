Version 7.1.0

* Added 3 ultra-difficult Silly MagicBounties that use end-game weapons
* Elite Phase Ship doctrine now prioritizes Anubis (instead of Omen) as its warship
* Fixed Adversary crisis factor not being added mid-game if the Colony Crisis intel already exists
* Adjusted New Opportunity Hycean planet to account for Unknown Skies nerf



Version 7.0.0 (Update for Starsector 0.98a)

* Compiled to Java 17
* Added Anubis to Adversary faction
* Removed dependency on Customizable Star Systems
  - The Optimal system generation is now built into the Adversary mod
  - The system now automatically supports Unknown Skies conditions and Industrial.Evolution industries
  - The system can spawn mid-game if it does not already exist
  - The one in the customStarSystems.json will be disabled by default
  - Added "enableAdversaryOptimal", "enableAdversaryUSOptimal", and "enableAdversaryIndEvoOptimal" settings to settings.json and LunaSettings
* Optimal Barren planet no longer has a Planetary Shield; its Heavy Batteries have been improved to partially compensate
* Fixed "enableAdversarySCSupport" option wrongly using the "enableAdversarySillyBounties" value if LunaLib was enabled
* Replaced Crew Training with Hull Restoration for Adversary commander skills
* Changes to specialized Adversary doctrines:
  - Now prioritizes the Hermes, Dram, and Mercury over the larger logistic ships to further bolster auto-resolve strength
  - Now also prioritizes non-primary ship types (e.g., Low Tech Carrier doctrine now also prioritizes Grendels and Vanguards)
* "enableAdversaryPersonalFleet" and related settings renamed to "enableAdversarySDF"
* Sword of Destruction fleet now made more difficult
* Now uses ColonyCrisisSetupListener to add the Adversary Colony Crisis
* Adversary CC attack changes:
  - Spawned fleets now focus on using more ships instead of higher-quality ships
  - Smaller attack fleets now favor using smaller ship classes over larger ones
  - Reduced reputation gain for defeating the attack
  - The enraged version is now much, much harder
* Modified some MagicBounty variants to account for 0.98a balance changes
* Nexerelin change: Adversary faction no longer has the "Neutralist" trait



Version 6.4.1

* Adversary doctrine changes:
  - Officer quality/ship quality/fleet size distribution is now 5/1/1 (from 3/2/2)
  - Commander skills changed to Officer Training and Crew Training (from Support Doctrine and Crew Training)
  - This change should optimize both the Adversary's auto-resolve strength and in-combat strength
* Minor code refactors



Version 6.4.0

* Adversary officers now always generate with at least 1 set skill
  - All doctrines, including the default/base doctrine, always use Combat Endurance as the 1st skill
  - Non-default Adversary doctrines will prioritize at least 3 officer skills, tailored towards the doctrine's ship choices
  - Added "officerSkills" to "adversaryPossibleDoctrines" in settings.json
* Adjusted the specialized Adversary doctrines:
  - Much more selective and coherent with ship, weapon, and fighter choices
  - Now prioritizes larger logistic ships (e.g., Atlas, Prometheus, Revenant, etc.)
  - Should generally make those doctrines more interesting to face off against while they are active
* Added Gorgon SRM Pod and Gazer SRM Pod to Adversary's known weapon list (I forgot)
* Moved Commissioned Crews hullmod code to "org.tranquility.adversary.hullmods"
  - If you have that mod installed, make sure to remove all CHM hullmods from your fleet before updating!



Version 6.3.1

* Added basic Ashes of the Domain: Question of Loyalty mod support
  - Mainly just setting rank/points thresholds similar to the major vanilla factions; no special ranks yet
* Fixed Pirate bounty not correctly configuring its officers
* "enableAdversarySCSupport" is now enabled by default
* Changed some SiC skills for some MagicBounties



Version 6.3.0

  - Adjusted the orbits and orbital positions for most orbiting entities in the system
  - Optimal Gate now located further away from the center
  - All High Commands now have SP improvements (from only the Gas Giant)
  - Gas Giant: Heavy Batteries now has an SP improvement
  - Toxic planet: Megaport now uses a Gamma Core (from Alpha Core)
  - Barren planet: Replaced Fullerene Spool with a Hypershunt Tap; its Megaport now has an SP improvement
  - Jungle planet: Removed Fullerene Spool and Combat Drone Replicator; its Megaport now has an SP improvement
  - Adjusted planetary conditions for the Unknown Skies version
* Added an optional Adversary custom star system in customStarSystems.json
  - Requires both Unknown Skies and Industrial.Evolution to successfully enable with no issues
  - Essentially a balanced version of the Paradiso system
  - Contains most vanilla and Industrial.Evolution special items, as well as the [REDACTED] ruined buildings
* Changed "enableSCSupportForBounties" setting to "enableAdversarySCSupport"
  - Added the corresponding LunaSetting; still disabled by default
  - Changed SiC skills for many MagicBounties
* Adversary CC scout fleet no longer spawns with non-phase civilian ships
* Fixed Mutual Tenacity stability tooltip showing the doubled bonus despite already being doubled
  - Actual bonus still unchanged; this just aligns it with the vanilla tooltip for the boosted Luddic Majority condition
* Some code refactors
