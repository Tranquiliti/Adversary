# This is simply a reference guide for making and editing custom star systems in settings.json.
# It should not affect the game in any way.

# Most type ids are found in the .csv files located in the Starsector/starsector-core/data/campaign folder

# The units for "orbitRadius", "size", and other similar entries are in pixels (e.g. "size":100 means something is 100 pixels wide)
# For reference, the Barad gas giant in the Corvus system has a size of 300 pixels

# When testing custom star systems, it is recommended that you either have installed the Console Commands mod or have enabled "devMode" via starsector-core's settings.json to quickly test and debug any errors.
# Any mistakes will likely cause a crash upon creating a new game or, even worse, crash your game upon visiting the affected star system or planet.

# Open presetStarSystems.json for some preset custom star systems to copy or edit.
