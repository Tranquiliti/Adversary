		"HA_mainRowTooltip1":"A rival independent polity poses an existential threat to the Adversary, whose leaders view your growing colonies as nothing more than preparations to take over their \"perfect\" worlds.",
		"HA_mainRowTooltip2":"Adversary-aligned scouts have been occasionally sighted inside your systems - though normally non-hostile, their presence alone bears ill tidings for nearby colonies.",
		"HA_mainRowTooltipEnd":"While these scouts are unlikely to directly harass your colonies in the short-term, it is almost certain that, if not convinced of your benevolent intentions in time, the Adversary's leaders will plan something far, far worse against your colonies.",
		"HA_mainRowTooltipEndAlt":"It is all but certain that, due to your heinous actions against the Adversary worlds, the leaders of the Adversary will swiftly respond in kind against your colonies.",

		"HA_stageTooltip":"Adversary bombardment campaign",

		"HA_activityCauseDesc":"Colony presence and size",
		"HA_activityCauseAltTooltip1":"Saturation-bombarding one of the Adversary's worlds has only pushed their collective resolve - and their immense hatred - against you to the absolute maximum.",
