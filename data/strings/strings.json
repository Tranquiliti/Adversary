		"HA_mainRowTooltip2":"Adversary-aligned scouts have been occasionally sighted inside your systems. Although these fleets normally avoid direct confrontation, their presence alone bears ill tidings for nearby colonies.",

		"HA_activityCauseAltTooltip1":"The saturation bombardment of an Adversary world has only pushed the inhabitants' collective resolve - and their immense hatred - against you to the absolute maximum.",
