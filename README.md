This Starsector mod adds the Adversary, a player-like challenge faction that uses a dynamic mix of most vanilla ships, weapons, and fighters to overwhelm their foes.

Includes Nexerelin, LunaLib, and Commissioned Crews support, as well as several MagicLib bounties and a few Customizable Star Systems presets.
